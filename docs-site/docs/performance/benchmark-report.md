# Benchmarking Report: Veloxx vs. Competitors

## Overview
This report compares the performance of Veloxx against popular data manipulation libraries in Python (Pandas, Polars, Dask) and JavaScript (Lodash). The benchmarks focus on common operations such as reading CSV files, filtering data, and grouping.

## Python Benchmarks
- **Pandas**: 0.008307 seconds
- **Polars**: 0.022585 seconds
- **Dask**: 0.091649 seconds
- **Veloxx**: 0.018716 seconds

## JavaScript Benchmarks
- **Veloxx**: 0.014000 seconds
- **Lodash**: 0.014000 seconds

*Note: We attempted to include Danfo.js and AlaSQL in the JavaScript benchmarks, but encountered technical challenges. We will revisit this in future benchmark updates.*

## Conclusion
In Python, Pandas demonstrates the best performance, followed by Veloxx, Polars, and Dask. In JavaScript, Veloxx performs comparably to Lodash. These results suggest that Veloxx is a competitive alternative for data manipulation tasks in both Python and JavaScript environments. However, further testing with more complex datasets and operations is recommended to fully evaluate its capabilities.
